# Anime-Association
A local WhatsApp group chat that I plan to turn into something bigger...

In my little town where I live, we have a group chat where we exchange info about Anime, Movies, Cartoons, stuff like that. It's where we feel like we are home away from home, or another home within a home, sharing info and updates, sharing some ridiculously humorous memes and jokes, and just basically having a ton of fun!

So then I thought, 'Hey why not share our joy with the rest of the world, and let the rest of the world do the same?', and this is the result of that idea.

I am still learning how to make websites with the three languages HTML, CSS and JS, but I plan on going beyond that. For now this is an idea that I'm toying around with, to get some experience in so to speak. I don't know exactly where I am going with this - hell, I may even trash the idea midway! But I'll do my best to... well... do my best (lamest line ever *sweatdrops*)
